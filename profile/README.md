# 🧬 Cyrrus Delta Labs

**Cyrrus Delta Labs** is an independent research and development collective building tools at the intersection of **automation**, **data sovereignty**, and **decentralized technologies**.

We design and build open, intelligent, and ethical software for digital autonomy.

## 🔍 What We Do

Cyrrus Delta Labs focuses on creating transparent and automatable systems that give individuals and developers back control over their digital infrastructure.

Our projects explore and combine:

- 🔁 **Automation & API Engineering**
  Task orchestration, scriptable workflows, smart bots, and low-friction developer tooling.

- 🧠 **Digital Privacy & Data Control**
  Tools that enable users to delete, monitor, and manage their data across platforms — respecting privacy-first principles and user consent.

- ⛓️ **Blockchain & Web3 Development**
  Smart contract engineering, transaction automation, secure wallet integration, and monitoring infrastructure for decentralized systems.

- 📡 **Cross-ecosystem Interoperability**
  Bridging Web2 and Web3 logic: linking centralized APIs (like Twitter, GitHub) with decentralized protocols.

## 🌐 Vision

We believe that software should be:

- **Understandable** (clear, documented, human-readable)
- **Automatable** (able to serve the user at scale)
- **Decentralized** (owned and run at the edges)
- **Private-first** (no unnecessary data retention or leakage)

Cyrrus Delta Labs builds with a strong emphasis on **sovereignty**, **interoperability**, and **resilience**.

## 🧪 Example Projects

- **Twitter Delete Bot** – privacy automation using the Twitter API and personal archives
- **Smart contract lifecycle tools** – on-chain action schedulers and cleanup bots
- **Web3<>Web2 data bridges** – bots that connect public APIs with blockchain triggers
